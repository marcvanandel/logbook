# Marc's Logbook

This is my personal logbook with entries I'm interested in. These are mainly technical and emerging and somehow related to government(s).

This logbook is based on the great work of [Molly White](https://www.mollywhite.net/) with her [Static Timeline Webpage](https://github.com/molly/static-timeline-generator)
